              <FaCode className="inline-block mr-2" /> 
              After gaining hands-on experience in building projects and exploring financial markets, I decided to delve deeper into the world of software engineering and AI by pursuing my masterâ€™s. It was during this journey that I discovered the exciting synergy between programming and trading systems. This realization sparked my passion for creating innovative, AI-driven software solutions, especially for Algotrading and intelligent financial applications.
            </p>
            <p>
              When I&apos;m not crunching numbers or coding, you might find me:
              </p>
              <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
              <li><FaChessKnight className="inline-block mr-2" /> Strategizing every move on the chessboard like a grandmaster in the making</li>
              <li><FaGuitar className="inline-block mr-2" /> Channeling the soul of the blues through every bend and slide on my guitar</li>
              <li><FaHorseHead className="inline-block mr-2" /> Horse riding to feel the wind and freedom of the open trail</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
            Currently, Iâ€™m doing my internship at BMW, where Iâ€™m gaining hands-on experience in advanced software engineering for automated driving. Alongside this, Iâ€™m diving deeper into the fascinating world of deep learning and AI software, exploring its limitless potential. Whether itâ€™s building innovative solutions or refining my expertise, Iâ€™m always excited to push the boundaries of what technology can achieve.
